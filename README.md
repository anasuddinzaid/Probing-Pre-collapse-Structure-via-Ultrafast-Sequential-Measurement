# Probing-Pre-collapse-Structure-via-Ultrafast-Sequential-Measurement
Independent research proposing Quantum Meristem States (QMS), transitional pre-collapse quantum structures detectable via ultrafast measurement. Predicts internal micro-evolution of wavefunction collapse and extends Vibrational Information Field Theory (VIFT).
